previously while creating an springboot application from spring.io site , it was leading to the " unknown error "
error in line no1 itself.

for resolving this issue you have to either of the followings

1 --> either we have to downgrade the parent version of the maven parent version have to use some stable
 older version by changing the version value in the parent tag like bellow
   
   from: 
       
       <parent>
           .
           .
           <version>2.2.5.RELEASE</version>
           .
           .
       </parent>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
   TO :
      
      <parent>
           .
           .
           <version>2.1.4.RELEASE</version>
           .
           .
       </parent>

2 --> also we can solve this problem by following manner as well
 go to <properties> tag and there already java version will be mentioned just after that write
 
 <maven-jar-plugin.version>3.1.1</maven-jar-plugin.version>
 
 after that java version.
 
 i.e : 
 
   <properties>
		<java.version>1.8</java.version>
		<maven-jar-plugin.version>3.1.1</maven-jar-plugin.version>
   </properties>
