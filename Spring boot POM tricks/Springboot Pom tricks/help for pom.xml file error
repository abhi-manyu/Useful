previously while creating an springboot application from spring.io site , it was leading to the " unknown error "
error in line no1 itself.

for resolving this issue you have to either of the followings

1 --> either we have to downgrade the parent version of the maven parent version have to use some stable
 older version by changing the version value in the parent tag like bellow
   
   from: 
       
       <parent>
           .
           .
           <version>2.2.5.RELEASE</version>
           .
           .
       </parent>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
   TO :
      
      <parent>
           .
           .
           <version>2.1.4.RELEASE</version>
           .
           .
       </parent>

2 --> either we may have obsolute m2e eclipse plugin , so in their latest version they have solved this issue,
   so we can check and update the M2E(Maven to Eclipse) plugin version by going to installing new software
      help --> install new software --> what is already installed --> and search for " M2e ".
   selecting that one and updating that version also solve this problem.
   
*****************************************************************************************************************

3 --> also we can solve this problem by following manner as well
 go to <properties> tag and there already java version will be mentioned just after that write
 
 <maven-jar-plugin.version>3.1.1</maven-jar-plugin.version>
 
 after that java version.
 
 i.e : 
 
   <properties>
		<java.version>1.8</java.version>
		<maven-jar-plugin.version>3.1.1</maven-jar-plugin.version>
   </properties>
