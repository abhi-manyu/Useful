/* for normal http call in java version greater than or equal to 11, there is one separate and class called HttpClient is there form oracle
that helps us to connect and call the http request directly from out java code.*/

example :
  
  HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .GET()
                .uri(URI.create("https://httpbin.org/get"))
                .setHeader("User-Agent", "Java 11 HttpClient Bot")
                .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = httpClient.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());


/* but for java 8 , there is no way we can use use HttpClient directly
so for that we have to use Apache HttpClient and we will be able to call. */

eaxmple : 

    HttpGet request = new HttpGet(url);
		String file=null;
		HttpResponse response=null;
		
		response = httpClient.execute(request);
		System.out.println("status code is :"+response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
		HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
		file = EntityUtils.toString(entity);
